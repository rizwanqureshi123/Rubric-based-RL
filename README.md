# Rubric-based-RL
Rubric-driven evaluation task for auditing an ML incident analysis. The dataset includes the incident log, golden response, and strict grading rubric; the harness enforces evidence-cited JSON verdicts so models must reference user-level leakage, the 3.8% class imbalance, and the 18% recall drop before passing.
